DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. File List: 
	(1) Metadata on waterbody characteristics 
	(2) Metadata for the temperature datasets
	(3-36) Time series temperature data for each waterbody

2. Relationship between files: Time series temperature data used to establish mixing regimes; waterbody characteristics were used to predict drivers of mixing regimes


METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for data compilation: Please see associated manuscript

2. Methods for processing the data: Please see associated manuscript
